## Summary
üßæ Summary

This project investigates how changes to the ‚ÄúSHOP NOW‚Äù button design affect user engagement, measured by Click-Through Rate (CTR).
The goal is to increase the number of users clicking the button by testing variations in color and text, and to determine which combination performs best.

Four versions of the button were tested:

Version A (Control): Black, ‚ÄúSHOP NOW‚Äù

Version B: Red, ‚ÄúSHOP NOW‚Äù

Version C: Black, ‚ÄúSEE DEALS‚Äù

Version D: Red, ‚ÄúSEE DEALS‚Äù

This is a multivariate A/B test, allowing us to isolate the effects of color, text, and their interaction on click behavior.
## Objective

To determine which button design achieves the highest conversion rate (CTR) and understand how color and text changes impact user engagement.

Specifically:

Compare CTRs across all four button designs.

Identify if text or color changes have stronger influence on clicks.

Ensure results are statistically significant (not due to chance).
## Test Version
| Version | Button Color     | Text         | Type        |
| ------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| A       | Black        | SHOP NOW     | Control     |
| B       | Red          | SHOP NOW    | Treatment 1 |
| C       | Black        | SEE DEALS | Treatment 2 |
| D       | Red          | SEE DEALS | Treatment 3 |

## Key Learnings
Learned how color and text changes can influence user interaction.

Practiced A/B and multivariate testing methodologies.

Gained experience with randomization, data logging, and CTR analysis.

Understood the importance of statistical significance in experiment results.
## Challenges Overcame
Ensuring equal random assignment of users across groups.

Managing sample size requirements for statistical validity.

Avoiding confounding factors by isolating one element per test.

Translating technical test results into clear marketing insights.
## Additional Reflections
This project demonstrated the power of data-driven design decisions.
Even small changes ‚Äî like color or text ‚Äî can lead to measurable improvements in user engagement.

A well-structured A/B test not only improves conversion rates but also fosters a culture of experimentation, ensuring design and marketing teams work together toward measurable business growth.

## Action Plan

‚úÖ Conduct multivariate A/B test with four button versions.
‚úÖ Track CTR for each version.
‚úÖ Perform significance testing on results.
‚úÖ Select the best-performing button for implementation.
‚úÖ Plan future A/B tests on additional site elements.
